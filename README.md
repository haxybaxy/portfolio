Welcome to my portfolio website! ðŸš€
## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This portfolio website is built using **React** and **Vite**, with **Three.js** for the 3D head. The experience section is inspired by my personal **Neovim** setup (try some keybinds ðŸ¤“), and the projects section is default **tmux** configuration, (mine is customized but the default is more recognizable).
