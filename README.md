Welcome to my portfolio website! ðŸš€
## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This portfolio website is built using **React** and **Vite**, with **Three.js** for the 3D head. 
The experience section is inspired by a 'modern' setup for **Neovim**, you can use j and k for navigating jobs and v and i to try and enter "visual" / "insert" modes. 
The projects section is based on the default **tmux** set up, since I thought it would be more immediately recognizable compared to a more customized one.
